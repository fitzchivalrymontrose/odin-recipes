    <p>Servings: 12</p>
    <p>Yield: 12 rolls</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/ 45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Lightly grease two baking sheets.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the yeast mixture with the sugar, salt, oil and 1 cup of flour; stir well to combine. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Divide the dough into twelve equal pieces and form into rounds. Place the rounds on prepared baking sheets. Cover the rolls with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to cool.
        </li>

    </ol>
